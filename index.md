# Darby Gallagher's First CS193 Homework

### Some fun things about CS193 (in order) 

- It's actually helpful because I don't know anything about coding or any tools 
- Gets me familiar with stuff that'll help me later on 
- It's only once a week! 
- Class isn't in a giant humid lecture hall 
- Instructors are chill
